"lambda_L_L_M"





 the nontrivial minimum of the potential is at "R = 1.984" 

Step 1: R0 = 2.289814180943, Bracket: (-10.000000000000, 200.000000000000)
Step 2: R0 = 2.289814636146, Bracket: (0.189814180943, 4.389814180943)
Step 3: R0 = 2.289814388593, Bracket: (2.285614636146, 2.294014636146)
Step 4: residuals tinyâ€”stopping at R0 = 2.289814388593

 Final R0: 2.289814388592608 

Integration reached (x=2.463, R=1.984)

 our solution approaches a value that is about '0.000000087' units away from the target value at infinity
